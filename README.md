Means Clustering with Elbow Method and Colormaps

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use the KMeans algorithm to perform clustering on a dataset. The script also includes the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and visualizes the results using different colormaps in Matplotlib.

Features

KMeans Clustering: 
Apply KMeans clustering to the dataset.
Elbow Method:
Determine the optimal number of clusters.
Visualization: 
Scatter plots with  colormaps plasma.
